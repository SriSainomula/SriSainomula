I am a second-year MTech student in Electronic Systems Engineering at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, and part of the Reconfigurable Computing Lab at DESE. 
My interests are in Digital Design. Currently working on the Hardware Accelerator of BWFA-MEM2 on Alveo U50 using HLS.
Alongside digital design, I enjoy programming and creating random hobby projects in Arduino, LTSpice.
